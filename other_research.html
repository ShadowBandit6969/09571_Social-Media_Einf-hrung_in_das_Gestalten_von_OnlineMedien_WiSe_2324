            What is online Media ?
        </h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Definition:</strong> Online media, alternatively termed digital media or digital content, 
                encompasses all forms of information and content generated, disseminated, and 
                consumed via the internet or digital platforms. This broad category includes 
                websites, blogs, news articles, videos, podcasts, online magazines, various social 
                media platforms, and other digital formats</li>
            <li>CD, Internet, digital Media...</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>

        <h2>Platform Architecture and Infrastructure:</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>  The platform's foundation is built on its architecture, which, in turn, depends on a robust infrastructure. The internet serves as the overarching framework, utilizing a client/server model with various interconnected components. This hierarchical structure ensures seamless functionality and interaction within the platform.</li>
        <h2>Client/Server architecture:</h2>
        <li><strong>What happends when you type an URL in a Browser</strong></li></h2>
            <ul>
        <li> Browser looks up the IP - Adress in the DNS Cache</li>
            <li> Browser identifies the IP - Adress by a recursive DNS lookup.The DNS (Domain Name System) resolver plays a crucial role in translating human-readable domain names into IP addresses that computers use to identify each other on a network. There are two main types of DNS queries: recursive and iterative. When a DNS resolver uses recursive lookup, it means that the resolver is responsible for finding the requested information on behalf of the client. Here's a simplified overview of how it works:</li>
            <li>Browser establishes a <a href="https://www.techtarget.com/searchnetworking/definition/TCP">TCP</a> to the Server.</li>
            <li>Browser sends a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Overview">HTTP</a> to the Server.</li>
            <li>The Server sends back the HTTP response.</li>
            <li>Browser renders the HTTP connection.</li>
    </ul>

        <h2>Frontend Development</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Frontend development, or "front-end," is a discipline in web and software development that focuses on creating visually appealing and user-friendly user interfaces (UI) and experiences (UX). Frontend developers concentrate on the client side, dealing with what users interact with in their browsers. A good UI effectively presents information, while UX encompasses the overall positive and efficient user interaction with a product. Web pages are composed of HTML for content structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for interactivity.

            CSS layouts define the structure and arrangement of elements on a web page, determining their position, size, and relationships. In programming, languages like JavaScript serve as a secret code to instruct computers, enabling users to teach their computers to perform cool and fun tasks by providing step-by-step instructions that the computer follows.</li>

    <section class ="section">
    <h2>Backend Development</h2>
        <ul>
    <li>An API (Application Programming Interface) is a set of protocols and tools that enables developers to interact with the backend services of a platform. It provides a way for external applications to access and utilize the features of the system programmatically. APIs allow third-party developers to integrate platform functionality into their applications, fostering a broader ecosystem of interconnected services and enhancing user experiences beyond the official platform.

        Common HTTP methods, such as GET for data retrieval, POST for submitting content, and DELETE for removing resources, are typically utilized by APIs. These methods enable developers to interact programmatically with the backend, facilitating actions like accessing data, posting content, and managing interactions.</li>

        <h2>Server Hosting and Deployment </h2>
        <ul>
          <li>A server is a system that delivers services to clients in a network, and hosting involves providing the infrastructure for websites or applications to be accessible online. Web hosting companies offer server space for storing website files, databases, and assets. Deployment is the process of making a software application or system available for use.</li>
          </ul>
          <h2>Server-side vs. client-side </h2>
          <ul>
            <li>
                Client-side code executes on the user's computer, downloaded and run by the 
browser when a web page is viewed. It's responsible for the page's display. In 
contrast, server-side code runs on the server, and its outcomes are downloaded and 
displayed in the browser, handling processes on the server side. JavaScript is 
employed in various contexts, functioning both on the client side for interactive web 
elements and on the server side for backend operations.
