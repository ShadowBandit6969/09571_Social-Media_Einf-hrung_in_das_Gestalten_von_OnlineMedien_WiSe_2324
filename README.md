In the first HTML document "About Me" I created a tabular resume. 
With some CSS style commands I was able to display the content appropriately. 
By applying JavaScript code, I was able to create a gradient that causes the various "section" blocks 
that are above or below the central content to lose opacity when they are not in the visible area of the screen. 
This creates an appealing visual effect when scrolling. The website consists of various sections including personal information, 
educational background, internships, skills and hobbies. 
In the CSS styles, I color-coded the background and added shadows and rounded corners for the sections to create a modern look. 
The header and navigation are designed in contrasting colors to create a clear separation between the different parts of the website.
The JavaScript handleScroll function is called when the page loads and checks whether each section is within the visible area of the screen. 
Depending on this, the fade-out class is added or removed to adjust the opacity. This creates the gradual transition effect when scrolling.

The second HTML document is called “Calculator”. I used the same CSS structure there. This task involved incorporating the learning content 
of a lecture into my own website. The programming of how the calculator works was done in JavaScript.

In the third HTML document "Curriculum" I created an interactive timetable that displays the current courses and lectures 
with their respective times, locations and links to relevant resources. The timetable is presented in tabular form, 
using different colors for the days of the week and times to improve clarity. The webpage also contains a navigation bar
with links to other sections of the website, including "About Me", "Calculator", "Curriculum", "Instagram Research" 
and "Other Research". The header highlights the focus on the timetable with the title “Timetable”. 
The stylesheet and the JavaScript code (transparent section blocks) were taken from the other documents. 
The footer contains the LMU Munich logo as a visual element. This timetable allows me to quickly access 
information about my current courses, with links to each module embedded.

In the fourth HTML document "Instagram Research" and the associated content, I presented research 
results and analyzes related to Instagram. The use of CSS and JavaScript enables a dynamic scrolling effect and a clear presentation of the research content.

In the fifth HTML document "Other Research" I want to show my knowledge on various aspects of online media, technologies, platform architecture, 
development (frontend and backend), server hosting, deployment, programming languages, dependencies, debugging, SQL, databases, version control systems and GIT.
